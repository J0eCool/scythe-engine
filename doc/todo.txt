sorted roughly by likely-to-implement order

- resizable window
- mouse input, controller input
- UI widgets
- rebuild the game on a background thread to avoid stutter
- auto-rebuild game.dll when it changes
    - need to look up how to poll file metadata on windows
- measure frame time and delay a dynamic amount
- unit tests for input handling

wontfix:
- split rendering out to its own .dll
    too much architecting for too little payoff atm
    while it'd be nice to practice this microservice style of programming,
    the main focus at the moment is "make game dev fun again"
    and the renderer being in its own .dll doesn't spark joy there
    As A Game Programmer: I don't care about how the renderer is implemented
