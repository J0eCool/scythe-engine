# September 2024
- Working on a platformer prototype
	- Start
		- Need to ideate on the design more
		- core idea is to play around with large complex engaging room design
		- implementation-wise, need to be able to move the character in "3D"
		- need to give the character the ability to move up and down
			- and keep the ability to jump? will need to add a z coordinate
			- this means we'll need to write `Vec3` 
	- Design
		- make a 3x3 grid of platforms at N different elevations
		- should be able to jump up a delta of 1, or down any number
		- this creates a digraph, and possible easy backtracking, esp. if we add powerups that increase crossable distances
- Engine improvements
	- selected scene is remembered across reloads
	- using `ui.label("\n")` as an alias for `ui.line()` cuts LOC in half
- [[Eyeball Generator]]
	- Design
		- simple eye consists of 3 shapes: cornea, iris, eyebrow
		- cornea drawn via testing if point is between upper and lower curve
		- sliders to tweak params
	- Made EyeGenScene, copied from TexGenScene
		- we'll want to share the uiParams logic, probably factor out into a uilib.h
		- for now just hardcode params to get something working
		- "programmatically creating a texture" is something we're probably going to want to do more of; interfacing directly with SDL_CreateRGBSurface is dubious
		- most of the application does not want to think in SDL-shaped terms, it's an abstraction-layer mismatch
	- Need to enable different shapes
		- idea is to turn the space between both eye corners into a UV coordinate system then do simple math from there
- Todo
	- Switch between multiple textures in generator
	- Asset auto-reloading
