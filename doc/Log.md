- Working on a platformer prototype
	- Need to ideate on the design more
	- core idea is to play around with large complex engaging room design
	- implementation-wise, need to be able to move the character in "3D"
	- need to give the character the ability to move up and down
		- and keep the ability to jump? will need to add a z coordinate
		- this means we'll need to write `Vec3`
