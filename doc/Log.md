# September 2024
- Working on a platformer prototype
	- Start
		- Need to ideate on the design more
		- core idea is to play around with large complex engaging room design
		- implementation-wise, need to be able to move the character in "3D"
		- need to give the character the ability to move up and down
			- and keep the ability to jump? will need to add a z coordinate
			- this means we'll need to write `Vec3` 
	- Design
		- make a 3x3 grid of platforms at N different elevations
		- should be able to jump up a delta of 1, or down any number
		- this creates a digraph, and possible easy backtracking, esp. if we add powerups that increase crossable distances
- Switch between multiple textures in generator
- Eyeball Generator
	- Design
		- simple eye consists of 3 shapes: cornea, iris, eyebrow
		- cornea drawn via testing if point is between upper and lower curve
		- sliders to tweak params
